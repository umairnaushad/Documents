All data written to Azure Storage is automatically encrypted by Storage Service Encryption (SSE) with a 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher.
By default, storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network
Currently, Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Storage is available for the Blob service.
Azure Files provides a cloud-based file share for storing and sharing files.
Server Message Block (SMB)
Storage Account:
    Standard performance: Double-digit ms latency, 10,000 IOPS, 300-MBps bandwidth, HDD
    Premium performance: Single-digit ms latency, 100,000 IOPS, 5-GBps bandwidth, SDD
    
    AzCopy 	Command-line tool that offers the best performance, especially for a low volume of small files.
Robocopy 	Command-line tool shipped with Windows and Windows Server. AzCopy is written to be Azure aware and performs better.
Azure Storage Explorer 	Graphical file management utility that runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
Azure portal 	Use the portal to import files and folders.
Azure File Sync 	Can be used to do the initial data transfer, and then uninstalled after the data is transferred.
Azure Data Box 	If you have up to 35 TB of data and you need it imported in less than a week.
Azure File Sync supports DACLs.
AzCopy requires a shared access signature (SAS) to authorize access to the share.

 Azure AD => Subscriptions => rg => resources

scopes (subscriptions, resource groups, or resources)

A single storage account has a fixed rate limit of 20,000 I/O operations/sec. This means that a single storage account is capable of supporting 40 standard virtual hard disks at full throttle.
Security groups can be associated to a network interface (for per host rules), a subnet in the virtual network (to apply to multiple resources), or both levels.
The smallest subnet that is supported uses a /29 subnet mask. The largest supported subnet uses a /8 subnet mask.
Standard SKU public IP addresses always use the static allocation method.
Standard IPs are secure by default and closed to inbound traffic. 
Standard IPs are zone-redundant by default 
Network security groups are assigned to a network interface or a subnet.

Application Gateway manages the requests that client applications can send to a web app.
Basic load balancers can be used only with availability sets.

Azure Load Balancer is limited to only load balancing and handling port-forwarding for the TCP and UDP protocols
With ExpressRoute, your data doesnâ€™t travel over the public internet. ExpressRoute isnt encrypted
